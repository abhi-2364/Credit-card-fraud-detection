# Credit-card-fraud-detection
Financial fraud is a major worry in the current digital era since technological improvements have made transactions easier while creating new criminal activity opportunities. To reduce 
losses, preserve confidence, and protect the general stability of financial institutions, fraud 
detection in real-time is essential. We will be able to examine enormous volumes of 
transaction data to find trends and anomalies connected to fraudulent conduct by utilizing the 
power of machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVM, SGD classifier, 
KNN classifier, Na√Øve Bayes, Decision tree, Extra tree classifier, random forest, Extra trees 
classifier, MLP classifier and stack based model(DT, RF, Extra trees classifier).
